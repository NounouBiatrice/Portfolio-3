        <h3 class='titleres'>Berry’s BBQ - March 2013 - Jun 2013</h3>
        <p class='text2'>I developed wireframes, and corresponding flowcharts using the information I discovered interviewing my client to meet his website’s goals and designed and developed a responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP. </p>

        <h3 class='titleres'>Geno’s Coffee Shop and Bakery - Jan 2013 - Mar 2013</h3>
        <p class='text2'>I interviewed my client to determine his website’s audience, which determined the approach needed and any potential issues to comply with his website’s goals. I used this information to produce a fully optimized responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, and PHP.</p>

        <h3 class='titleres'>Bellevue College - 2000-2012</h3>
        <p class='text2'>I re-designed the Financial Aid Office’s website using HTML and CSS. I updated this website every year to inform students of new federal regulations and office’s new business practices when required. I had complete responsibility for design and content.</p>

        <h2 class='titleres1'>Job History</h2>

        <h3 class='titleres'>Bellevue College - Information Technology Specialist III Financial Aid Office, 2000-2012 </h3>
        <p class='text2'>I maintained all the different software systems used in the Financial Aid Office. These systems included: COCO and SAFERS (WA State community college systems), EDE Express, NSLDS, Pell Payment and Return of Title IV funds. I used many of these systems exclusively, and others were used in conjunction with the office staff, and, in that case, I served as trainer and problem solver for the staff. I also interviewed and assisted students in person and on the phone, who had questions and problems associated with all aspects of financial aid processing. I designed developed and maintained the Financial Aid Office's web page. I also served as a racial justice facilitator and led Courageous Conversations meetings. I also co-taught Racial Awareness classes for both staff, for the college at large, and regular students.</p>
